## Marketing Materials

### Product Hunt Description (Draft)
```
AbyssNotes: Your brain, your data, your rules.

A local-first personal knowledge base that combines:
📄 Obsidian-like markdown notes
📋 Kanban boards for tasks
🔗 Graph visualization of connections
🎯 Mission control dashboard

100% local, no cloud, no subscription.

Built for founders, developers, and privacy advocates.
```

### HN Post (Draft)
```
Show HN: I built a local-first alternative to Obsidian

I've been using Obsidian for years, but I kept opening
separate tools for task management and project tracking.
So I built AbyssNotes - a personal OS that combines:

- Markdown notes (Obsidian-style)
- Kanban boards (for tasks)
- Graph view (visualize connections)
- Mission control (for founders)

It's 100% local - no cloud, no account, no subscription.

I'm launching it today and would love feedback:
https://github.com/leviathofnoesia/abyssnotes

What features would make this useful for you?
```

### Reddit Post Template
```
Title: "AbyssNotes - Local-first alternative to Obsidian with Kanban + Graph + Mission Control"

Body:
I built AbyssNotes as a replacement for using 5 different apps.
It combines markdown notes, task management, graph visualization,
and a founder-focused mission dashboard into one tool.

Key features:
- Obsidian-like markdown editor
- Kanban boards (To Do, In Progress, Done, Blocked)
- Interactive graph of file connections
- Mission control for tracking revenue/goals

It's 100% local, open source (MIT), and free.

Check it out: https://github.com/leviathofnoesia/abyssnotes

Would love feedback from this community!

## Pricing Decision

**Choose by end of Week 2:**

### Option A: One-Time Purchase
- Personal: $49
- Team: $149
- Enterprise: $499

**Pros:** Simple, no recurring billing for users
**Cons:** Lower LTV, need constant new sales

### Option B: Freemium
- Free: All core features
- Pro: $9/month or $79/year

**Pros:** Recurring revenue, higher LTV
**Cons:** Need more features to justify subscription

**Recommendation:** Start with Option A (one-time), test market response, consider freemium in v2.0.
