Title: "AbyssNotes - Local-first alternative to Obsidian with Kanban + Graph + Mission Control"

Body:
Hi all,

I've been an Obsidian power user for years. But I kept opening separate tools for task management and project tracking.

So I built AbyssNotes - it combines:
- Markdown notes (Obsidian-style, local files)
- Kanban boards (To Do, In Progress, Done, Blocked)
- Interactive graph (D3.js force-directed)
- Mission control (for founders to track revenue/milestones)

It's 100% local - no cloud sync, no account needed, no subscription.

MIT licensed, open source.

GitHub: github.com/leviathofnoesia/abyssnotes

Would love feedback from this community. Does this solve a real problem? What features would you want?
