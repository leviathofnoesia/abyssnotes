## Pre-Launch Content Plan

### Week 1: Anticipation (Days 1-7)

**Day 1: Teaser Tweet**
```
Juggling 5 apps to run my startup is exhausting.

Notes here. Tasks there. Revenue somewhere else.

What if one tool did it all, 100% locally?

Building something. 🦞

**Day 2: Behind-the-Scenes**
```
[Screenshot of AbyssNotes interface]

Why I'm tired of SaaS subscriptions:
- $300/mo across 5 apps
- Data scattered everywhere
- Context switching kills productivity

Building one tool to rule them all.

Title: Show HN: I built a local-first alternative to Obsidian with Kanban + Graph + Mission Control

Body:
Hi HN,

I've been an Obsidian power user for years. But I kept opening separate tools for task management and project tracking.

It was exhausting. I was juggling:
- Notes in Obsidian
- Tasks in Trello
- Projects in Notion
- Revenue in spreadsheets

So I built AbyssNotes - a personal OS that combines:

- Markdown notes (Obsidian-style, local files)
- Kanban boards (To Do, In Progress, Done, Blocked)
- Interactive graph (D3.js force-directed visualization)
- Mission control (for founders to track revenue, milestones, features)

It's 100% local - no cloud sync, no account needed, no subscription.

MIT licensed, open source: github.com/leviathofnoesia/abyssnotes

I'm launching today and would love feedback:
- Does this solve a real problem for you?
- What features would make this useful?
- Is local-first dead or growing?

Technical details:
- Built with vanilla JavaScript (no framework)
- D3.js for graph visualization
- Express.js backend
- CLI tool included (abyssnotes commands)
- Cross-platform (Linux, Mac, Windows)

Thanks for reading!
```

### 12:00 PM PST - Reddit Posts

Title: "AbyssNotes - Local-first alternative to Obsidian with Kanban + Graph + Mission Control"

Body:
Hi r/ObsidianMD,

I've been an Obsidian user for years. Love the markdown workflow. But I kept needing separate apps for tasks and project tracking.

So I built AbyssNotes - it adds:
- Kanban boards (To Do, In Progress, Done, Blocked)
- Graph visualization (force-directed, D3.js)
- Mission control dashboard (for founders to track revenue/milestones)

It keeps Obsidian's markdown approach but adds structure I needed as a founder.

It's 100% local - no cloud sync, no account, no subscription.

MIT licensed, open source: github.com/leviathofnoesia/abyssnotes

Would love feedback from this community. Does this solve a real problem for you?

Title: "Built AbyssNotes to escape SaaS hell - one tool for notes + tasks + mission control"

Body:
Hey indie hackers,

I was spending $300/mo on 5 different SaaS subscriptions. App fatigue was real.

So I built AbyssNotes - one local tool that combines:
- Obsidian-like markdown notes
- Kanban boards
- Graph visualization
- Mission control for founders

100% local, no cloud, no subscription. MIT licensed.

GitHub: github.com/leviathofnoesia/abyssnotes

Would love feedback from other indie hackers!

All runs locally. No cloud sync. No account needed. No subscription.

### Day 13-14: Hot Take
```
Platform: Twitter (thread)

🧵 THREAD: Obsidian is great, but it's failing founders. Here's why:

Tweet 1/n: Obsidian is the best note-taking app I've used. Markdown-first, plugin ecosystem, local files.

Tweet 2/n: But founders need more than notes. We need task management. Revenue tracking. Launch planning.

Tweet 3/n: Obsidian has plugins for some of this. But juggling 10 plugins to match one integrated tool isn't great UX.

Tweet 4/n: That's why I built AbyssNotes. Notes + kanban + graphs + mission control, designed together.

Tweet 5/n: Local-first isn't just about privacy. It's about integration. Your tools should talk to each other.

Tweet 6/n: Not hating on Obsidian. Love it. Use it. But asking for better tools for founders is allowed.

Thoughts?

**Always:**
- Authentic and vulnerable

- Founder-focused, builder energy
- Practical, not theoretical

**Never:**
- Corporate or generic

## Crisis Management

**If Launch Flops:**
1. Analyze why (wrong timing? wrong audience? product not ready?)
2. Ask for feedback directly on HN/Reddit/Twitter
3. Iterate fast (fix real problems people mention)
4. Re-launch improved version

**If Negative Feedback:**
1. Respond publicly and respectfully
2. Own it if valid criticism
3. Explain rationale if different design choice
4. Update based on genuine issues
5. Thank them for the feedback

## Notes

- ClawHype framework emphasizes authenticity over virality
- Story-first marketing resonates better than feature lists
- Community-led growth requires helping others first
- Platform-specific approaches are critical (HN ≠ Twitter ≠ Reddit)
- Build in public creates narrative and anticipation

**Remember:** Authenticity beats virality every time.
